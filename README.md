## Hi!

Welcome to my page :smile: 

I am a sophmore in Boise State University. I like coding and in my leisure I like to paint.

### My Programming Journey

My first major was Materials and Metallurgical Engineering. Even though I liked my major I knew something was missing. I started coding by myself I when I was took an introductory course on computer programming. I did every exercise from my textbook and felll in love with coding.
After that I decided to change my major and swtich to Computer Science.
I have take CS121, CS221, CS150. I am taking CS250, CS271 right now. 
CS121 was easy for me but I learned a lot. I mostly enjoyed CS221. The course content was so much fun. I loved the way linked lists work and the idea of writing tests before writing the code blew my mind. 
Now, while I am learning about Agile methods, I learned that this is how software development should work, testing while building. 
I have done most of my work in Java. I also know C a little.

```markdown
I am listing some projects I did so far:

# Single Linked List implementation and testing
# Double Linked List implementation and testing
# Parsing files
# GUI Library
# Circuit Tracing 

```
### Research Interest
I am mostly interested in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. I would love to work in this field in future.

### Painting
During my leisure time I like to paint. My painting medium is watercolor. I mostly paint landscapes. During summer time I like to go to places and be close to nature.
